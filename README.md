#  Library Management System (LMS) â€” SQL Based Project

This project implements a simple yet comprehensive **Library Management System** using **MySQL**. It simulates real-world functionalities of a library, including book issuing, returns, employee management, member tracking, overdue detection, and report generation using advanced SQL queries and stored procedures.

---

##  Tech Stack

- **Database**: MySQL 8+
- **Tool**: MySQL Workbench
- **Language**: SQL (DDL, DML, Views, CTEs, Stored Procedures)

---

##  Database Schema

The system includes the following tables:

- `branch`: Stores library branch info and manager assignments
- `employees`: Employee details linked to branch
- `books`: Book metadata and pricing
- `members`: Library member details
- `issued_status`: Records book issue transactions
- `return_status`: Tracks returns and book condition

Foreign key constraints and relationships (including `1:1`, `1:N`) have been used to maintain **referential integrity**.

---

##  Key Functionalities

###  Data Management

- **Book Issuing**: `issued_status` table tracks which employee issued what book to which member.
- **Book Returns**: `return_status` tracks the return and book condition (e.g., `'good'`, `'damaged'`).

### ðŸ§  Business Logic (Queries)

- List members with **more than one book** issued
- **Rental income** generated by book categories
- Employees and their **branch managers**
- **Books not returned yet**
- Identify members with **overdue books** (>30 days)
- **Active members** in the last 6 months
- Members who **returned damaged books**
- **Branch performance reports** including:
  - Number of books issued
  - Books returned
  - Revenue generated

###  Stored Procedures

- `issue_book(member_id, book_isbn, emp_id)`: Issues a book
- `return_book(issued_id, book_condition)`: Logs a return with condition

##  Sample Queries Used

```sql
-- Find overdue books
SELECT *, DATEDIFF(NOW(), issued_date) AS days_issued_ago
FROM issued_status
WHERE DATEDIFF(NOW(), issued_date) > 30;

-- Books not yet returned
SELECT b.book_title
FROM issued_status ist
LEFT JOIN return_status rst ON ist.issued_id = rst.issued_id
WHERE rst.return_id IS NULL;
